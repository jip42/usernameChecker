# usernameChecker
a simple python script to check username availability for YouTube.
I used the requests and win10toast libraries for this. 
I also use Windows Task Scheduler along with this, but I think you can make a cron job to work with this as well. 

UPDATE Log:
-script now checks legacy links in YouTube to see whether it is *actually* free or not.
